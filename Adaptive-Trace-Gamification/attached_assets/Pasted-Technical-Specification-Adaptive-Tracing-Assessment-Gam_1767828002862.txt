Technical Specification: Adaptive Tracing Assessment Game (Static Web App)

1. Project Overview

Objective: A minimalist, high-precision tracing game designed for a learner named Sammy. The goal is to assess attention, performance, and behavior. The game must eliminate all distractions and maximize the interactive tracing area.
Target Environment: Cross-platform (iOS/Android/Web). Optimized for "Kiddie Tablets" (large area) and Smartphones (adaptive zoom).
Architecture: Pure Static Frontend (HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript). No backend required.

2. Core Gameplay Mechanics

A. The Tracing Path & Boundary

Visuals: Thick, deep-colored dashed lines (#4A4A4A).

Active Boundary: A "Safe Zone" buffer around the path.

Responsive Thickness: The path and boundary must scale based on the device's shortest side (min-dimension) to ensure it is always physically large enough for a human finger (approx. 15-20% of the screen width on phones, 10% on tablets).

Validation: Input is only registered within the boundary. Progress freezes if the user exits the safe zone.

B. Guidance & Idle Intelligence

Intro Demo: Upon task start, a visual pointer automatically traces the shape at a steady pace to demonstrate the required motion.

5-Second Idle Logic: 1.  If no input is detected for 5 seconds, the pointer reappears at the user's current progress point.
2.  It completes the shape as a "Ghost Trace."
3.  Once the demo finishes, it snaps back to the user's last position and pulses gently to invite interaction.

C. Adaptive Screen Scaling (Critical)

The "Fill" Mandate: The shape must occupy at least 85% of the viewport.

Tablet Strategy: Utilize the wide/large aspect ratio by centering the shape and using a wider "Comfort Zone" for tracing.

Smartphone Strategy: If the shape is complex (e.g., a long line or large letter), the game should dynamically scale the path to ensure the "turn radius" isn't too tight for a thumb.

Orientation: Support both Portrait and Landscape; the canvas must re-center and re-scale the path immediately on rotation.

3. Visual Assets (Task Sequence)

Fundamental Lines: Horizontal, Vertical, Zig-zag, Wavy, Spiral, and Large Loops.

Basic Geometry: Circle, Square, Triangle, Rectangle.

Complex Geometry: Star, Diamond, Pentagon, Hexagon, Heart, Crescent, and Oval.

4. Technical Best Practices & UX

A. Interaction Handling

Unified Pointer Events: Use pointerdown, pointermove, and pointerup to handle touch and mouse identically.

System Gesture Prevention: * CSS: touch-action: none; to disable scrolling and "pinch-to-zoom."

CSS: overscroll-behavior: none; to prevent "pull-to-refresh" or "swipe-to-go-back."

Zero-Latency Rendering: Use requestAnimationFrame for a consistent 60fps experience.

B. Tracing Logic Details

Path Interpolation: Store shapes as arrays of vectors (x, y). If a user moves their finger very fast, the code must interpolate between the last two points to ensure no gaps in progress.

Visual Feedback: As Sammy traces, the grey dashed line transforms into a solid, vibrant Success Green (#2ECC71).

C. Evaluation Metrics (Observer Summary)

At the completion of the task set, log the following to the console or a hidden summary overlay:

Attention Score: (Total time spent interacting) / (Total task time).

Precision Rate: Percentage of total path length traced within the boundary on the first attempt.

Assistance Count: How many times the 5-second Idle Demo was triggered.

5. UI/UX Style Guide

Background: Solid #F5F5F5 (Neutral, low-eye-strain).

Pointer Color: A distinct, semi-transparent blue or orange circle to provide clear contrast.

Transition: 500ms cross-fade between tasks. No loading screens or menus.

Audio (Optional): If requested later, use low-frequency, "soft" success tones.
